# From zero to Mastery Complete React Developer in 2023

This is the result of the course "Complete React Developer" of From Zero to Mastery. I did this project mostly in accordence with the course, though there are some deviations to the course. 

## Deviaton

I changed some semantics (button instead of clickable spans) for improved accessibility and different styles for improved responsiveness. The main deviation between my code and the course is that I finally didn't not implement the styled components as I preffer semantic classnames and visible html-tags throughout the code.
